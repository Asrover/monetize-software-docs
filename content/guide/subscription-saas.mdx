## What We'll Build

In this guide, you'll set up:

- ✅ Paywall with subscription plans
- ✅ Stripe or Paddle integration for payment processing
- ✅ Automatic subscription renewals
- ✅ Subscription status checking in your app
- ✅ Cancellation and renewal handling

## Setting up Payment Infrastructure

<Steps>

### Step 1: [Create paywall](/docs-v2/payment-processor/create-payment-processor)

### Step 2: [Create payment processor](/docs-v2/payment-processor/create-payment-processor)

### Step 3: [Connect payment processor to paywall](/docs-v2/payment-processor/connect-payment-processor)

### Step 4: [Install client-side SDK](/docs-v2/paywall-api/install-paywall)

</Steps>

## Integrating with Your Application

<Steps>

### Step 1: Basic Subscription Check

Add subscription status checking on app load:

```javascript
// Check subscription on page load
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async function() {
    try {
        const userInfo = await paywall.getUser();
        
        if (userInfo.paid) {
            // User has active subscription
            enablePremiumFeatures();
        } else {
            // User not subscribed
            showLimitedFeatures();
        }
    } catch (error) {
        // User not authenticated
        showGuestMode();
    }
});
```

### Step 2: Implement Feature Limitations

Create limitation system for non-subscribers:

```javascript
// Function that requires premium access or allows access in specific cases
async function performAdvancedExport() {
    try {
        // Try to open paywall and wait for successful purchase
        await paywall.open({ resolveEvent: 'success-purchase' });
        
        // User successfully purchased - allow advanced export
        executeAdvancedExport();
        
    } catch (error) {
        // Paywall was not opened or user didn't purchase
        // Check the specific reason to decide whether to allow access
        switch (error.visibility_status_reason) {
            case 'closed-by-user':
                // User manually closed paywall without payment
                // Don't show the feature - user explicitly declined
                showMessage('Upgrade required for advanced export');
                break;
                
            case 'openings-trial':
            case 'time-trial':
                // User is still in trial period
                // Allow access to premium features during trial
                executeAdvancedExport();
                showMessage('Trial feature - upgrade for unlimited access');
                break;
                
            case 'country-not-match':
                // User's location doesn't match paywall targeting settings
                // For example: paywall configured only for tier-1 countries
                // but user is from tier-2 or tier-3 country
                executeAdvancedExport();
                showMessage('Feature available in your region');
                break;
                
            case 'visibility-turned-off':
                // Paywall visibility is disabled in settings
                // Allow free access when paywall is intentionally disabled
                executeAdvancedExport();
                break;
                
            case 'active-payment-found':
                // User already has an active subscription or lifetime purchase
                // Full access granted
                executeAdvancedExport();
                break;
                
            default:
                // Unknown reason - show upgrade prompt
                showMessage('Please upgrade to access this feature');
        }
    }
}

```

</Steps>
