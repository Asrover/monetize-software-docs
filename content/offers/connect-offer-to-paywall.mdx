# Connect Offer to Paywall

Learn how to connect discount offers to your paywalls and manage offer assignments for optimal campaign performance.

## Overview

Once you've created an offer, you need to connect it to specific paywalls where it should appear. The offer connection system allows you to:

- **Assign one offer per paywall** for focused campaigns
- **Switch between offers** without affecting other paywalls

<Callout type="info">
  **One Offer Limit:** Each paywall can have only one active offer at a time. This ensures a clear, focused user experience without competing messages.
</Callout>

## How Offer Connection Works

### Offer Assignment Process

<Steps>
### Access Offer Manager

Navigate to your paywall settings and click on the **"Offer manager"** button.

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
    ![Paywall offer manager](/docs/offer-manager.jpg)
</div>

### Apply Selection

Select an offer and save. The system will:

- **Remove** any previously connected offer
- **Connect** the new offer to the paywall
- **Activate** the offer immediately

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
    ![Paywall offer manager save](/docs/offer-manager-save.jpg)
</div>

</Steps>

## Connection Management

### Single Offer Limitation

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Only one offer can be active per paywall at any time. Connecting a new offer will automatically disconnect the previous one.
</Callout>

## Connection States

### Offer Connection Lifecycle

<Steps>
    ### Created
    - Offer exists but not connected to any paywall
    - Available for connection
    - No impact on user experience

    ### Connected

    - Offer linked to specific paywall(s)
    - Ready to be displayed to users
    - Targeting rules apply

    ### Active

    - Offer currently showing to targeted users
    - Timer running (if duration-based)
    - Conversion tracking active

    <Callout type="info">
      **Duration-based Offers:** For duration-based offers, the start time is stored on the client side.
    </Callout>

    ### Expired

    - Timer has reached zero or end date passed
    - No longer shown to users
    - Connection remains for historical data
