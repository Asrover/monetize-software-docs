# Paywall Overview

A paywall serves as an in-app storefront where customers can browse products and make purchases. What sets it apart is its dynamic nature, allowing you to modify it without requiring app updates.

Paywalls provide a seamless way to monetize your application by offering
products directly within your app interface.

## Paywall States

Understanding the different states of your paywall is crucial for effective management and deployment. Each paywall operates under three distinct state categories:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card title="Payment States" href="#payment-states" />
  <Cards.Card title="Visibility States" href="#visibility-states" />
  <Cards.Card title="Activity States" href="#activity-states" />
</Cards>

### Payment States

<Tabs
  items={[
    { label: 'Test Mode', icon: <ExclamationTriangleIcon /> },
    { label: 'Live Mode', icon: <EyeIcon /> }
  ]}
>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Test Mode**: These paywalls are in testing mode. Use this state while
    testing your paywall payments until you are ready to switch to live mode.
    <Callout type="warning">
      Always thoroughly test your paywall in test mode before going live to
      avoid payment issues.
    </Callout>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    **Live Mode**: These paywalls are currently live. Use this state after
    successful testing.
    <Callout>
      Live mode processes real payments. Ensure all testing is complete before
      switching to this mode. You can always switch back to test mode if needed
      for further testing or debugging.
    </Callout>
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Visibility States

Control when your users can see and interact with your paywalls in real-time.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Th>State</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>Description</Table.Th>
      <Table.Th>User Experience</Table.Th>
    </Table.Tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>**Visible**</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Default setting. These paywalls are visible to users.</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Users can see and interact with the paywall</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>**Hidden**</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>These paywalls are not visible to users.</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Paywall is completely hidden from users</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>

    </Table.Tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>**Active**</Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>
        These paywalls are in the default state when you create or edit them.
      </Table.Td>
      <Table.Td>Full editing capabilities, can be hidden/shown</Table.Td>
    </Table.Tr>
    <Table.Tr>
      <Table.Td>**Archived**</Table.Td>
